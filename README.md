# Text Analysis Program

This JavaScript program reads a text file and performs analysis on various aspects of the text. It counts the number of words, letters, sentences, identifies repeated letters, and provides word frequency statistics.

## How to Use

1. **Install Node.js:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Download the Program:**
   Download the JavaScript file (`analyze_text.js`) to your local machine.

3. **Prepare Your Text File:**
   Save the text you want to analyze in a text file (e.g., `example.txt`). Place this file in the same directory as the program.

4. **Run the Program:**
   Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the program and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   node main.js
